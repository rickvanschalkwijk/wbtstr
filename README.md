## Overview
WbTstr.Net is a framework which makes testing the Web fun and productive. Under the hood, it uses Selenium WebDriver, which allows you to test in all the major browsers. We provide users with a very intuitive API that allows them to fully automate their functional testing without the hassle of complicated testing frameworks.
